STEP 1 : First, import the necessary libraries for GPIO control. We will be using the "GPIO" library from "RPi" and "sleep" from "time".

```
import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
from time import sleep
```

```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```
 
```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```
 
```
No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting. 
But let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.
