1. First, import the necessary libraries for GPIO control. We will be using the "GPIO" library from "RPi" and "sleep" from "time".

```python
import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
from time import sleep
```

2. Next, set the pin numbering mode to BCM. This means that we will be referencing the pins by their Broadcom SOC channel.

```python
GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)
```
